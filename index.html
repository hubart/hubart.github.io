what if modern artists make websites? Think about it, web is the perfect medium for modern art. It's interactive, accessible by anyone anytime, ever changing due to different screen sizes. This project is dedicated to all the modern artists who have greatly influenced almost every designers and artists now. To name a few: the grid system of mondrian, the popping color combinations by warhol, the expressive strokes by pollock. We owe a great debt to them and let's be honest, it's hard to create new breakthroughs after these modern artists. Our art and designs are inevitably always in their shadows.
