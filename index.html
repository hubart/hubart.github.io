What if modern artists make websites?<br/><br/> Think about it, web is the perfect medium for modern art. It's interactive, accessible by anyone anytime, ever changing due to different screen sizes.<br/><br/> This project is dedicated to all the modern artists who have greatly influenced almost every designers and artists now. To name a few: the grid system of mondrian, the popping color combinations by warhol, the expressive strokes by pollock.<br/><br/> We owe a great debt to them and let's be honest, it's hard to create new breakthroughs after these modern artists. Our art and designs are inevitably always in their shadows.
